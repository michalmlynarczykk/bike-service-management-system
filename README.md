# bike-service-management-system (in progress)
### Overview
This web app is a management system to help dealing with repair orders processed in bike service.
Every order has its own life cycle. Order could be in one of four stages: “new”, ”started”, “finished”, and “collected by client”.
On the main page of the system, all processed orders are display in appropriate columns according to their status 
(orders with the status "collected by client" are not visible here).

This application is for mechanics that are repairing bikes. It allows them to keep track of every order status.
The mechanic can also add a list of parts that he has used to repair the bike, and the system will automatically calculate the total price of the repair.
The system provides an organized tool to schedule work that has priority at the time. Application stores information about clients, bikes, and repairs.
